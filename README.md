# Match Game

Match Game is one of my first c# project that i do and i follow the tutorial of this [book](https://github.com/biignoisee/Head-First-C)

## But what is this all about?
I focused on following some of the instructions in the book and have been able to learn how to handle *visual studio 2022* üßë‚Äçüíª efficiently and also wanted to implement improvements. By the time you are reading this you may have already incorporated improvements.
